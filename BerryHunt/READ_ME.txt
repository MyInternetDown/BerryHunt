Game Description:

You are a Fox hunting for berries before winter comes. You must retrive 20 in order to have enough for the cold months ahead.
However, each berry is scattered around the map and you must find them. To obtain a berry, you will have to complete an econ question.
If you fail the question, you will be put back to your spawn. 

The purpose is to beat the game as fast as possible! Good Luck!
The timer will show how long you take. My record was 03:15:458. Do you think you can beat it?
